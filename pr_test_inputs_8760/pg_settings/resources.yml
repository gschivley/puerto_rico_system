# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

# Var_OM_Cost_per_MWh_In (https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-28866.pdf).
# Because Var_OM_Cost_per_MWh_In is not part of the ATB database the value should be set
# directly rather than using a list of [operator, value]. Operators ("add", "mul",
# "truediv", and "sub") can only be used to modify values that exist in the ATB database.
