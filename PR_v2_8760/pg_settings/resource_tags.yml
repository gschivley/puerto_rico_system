# CLUSTER TAGS
# All of the values will be 0 by default. If non-zero, add here.
# The names below are matched to technology names in the data ignoring case, whitespace,
# and underscores, and must only match the start of the technology name. Since e.g.
# "Natural Gas" will match any "Natural Gas *", more specific terms should be listed
# after more general terms ("Natural Gas CCS100: 0" should come after "Natural Gas: 1").
